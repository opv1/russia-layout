        Almost the entire peninsula is located beyond the Arctic Circle. Sami

        Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many also know
        that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the most
        beautiful places in Russia.

      <p class="places__text">
        Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for
        skiing competitions. Itâ€™s such a sport when a skier attaches itself to a
        motorcycle, and the tandem is trying to develop as much as possible more
        speed on ice. In March 2019 at the festival The Baikal Mile set a world
        record - 197.011 km / h.

        Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: forming a taiga Siberian
        larch does not grow west of Vodlozero. But here she is extends 30 meters

        Touch a living creature who saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw
